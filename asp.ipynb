    "### <b>i. Complex Field of a Light Wave</b> \n",
    "\n",
    "A <b>complex field</b> refers to the mathematical representation of a light wave. It describes the amplitude and phase of the electric field at each point in space. The complex field is represented using a complex number, which consists of a real part and an imaginary part.\n",
    "\n",
    "The <b>amplitude</b> of a light wave represents the strength or intensity of the electric field at each point. It determines the brightness or darkness of the light. In the complex field representation, the amplitude is represented by the real part of the complex number. A larger amplitude corresponds to a brighter light, while a smaller amplitude corresponds to a dimmer light.\n",
    "\n",
    "The <b>phase</b> of a light wave represents the position of the wave within its cycle. It determines the color or wavelength of the light. In the complex field representation, the phase is represented by the imaginary part of the complex number. The phase can be visualized as the angle of rotation of a vector in the complex plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complex field of a light wave allows us to describe and analyze the wave's characteristics, such as intensity and color, as it propagates through space and interacts with various objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>ii. Angular Spectrum Method (ASM)</b> \n",
    "\n",
    "The ASM is a mathematical technique used to describe how a complex field evolves as it propagates through space. It is particularly useful when dealing with wave propagation in free space or homogeneous media.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, it breaks down a complex field into its individual spatial frequency components, which correspond to different directions and magnitudes of wave propagation. By manipulating these components mathematically, we can predict how a complex field changes as it travels through space, ultimately allowing us to analyze and predict the behavior of light waves as they propagate through space and interact with optical systems. It is used in various areas of optics, such as diffraction, imaging, holography, and beam shaping.\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying <b>Fourier transforms</b> and other mathematical operations to the <b>Maxwell's equations</b>, which are fundamental equations in electromagnetism that describe the behavior of electromagnetic waves, we can derive the ASM formulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>iii. Fourier Transform</b> \n",
    "\n",
    "A Fourier transform is a mathematical operation used to decompose a function (in this case, the complex field of a light wave) into its frequency components. It allows us to analyze the spatial frequencies present in the complex field and understand how they contribute to the overall wave behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fourier transform provides a way to convert a function from the spatial domain (where the complex field is described in terms of positions in space) to the frequency domain (where the complex field is described in terms of spatial frequencies). This transformation allows us to represent the complex field in a different mathematical form, which can be useful for analysis and manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of the Angular Spectrum Method, the Fourier transform plays a crucial role. It is used to decompose the complex field of a wave into its constituent spatial frequency components. By performing Fourier transforms at different propagation distances, we can study how each frequency component evolves as the wave propagates through space. This information helps us understand the overall behavior of the wave and its interactions with optical systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the complex field, Angular Spectrum Propagator, and Fourier transform are fundamental concepts and mathematical tools used in optics to understand and analyze the behavior of light waves. They provide a framework to study wave propagation, diffraction, and various optical phenomena, enabling us to design and optimize optical systems for different applications.\n",

Finally, an Inverse Fourier Transform is performed to obtain the complex field in the spatial domain at the final plane.\n",
